Poly/ML for Isabelle
====================

This compilation of Poly/ML 5.5.2 is based on
http://sourceforge.net/p/polyml/code/HEAD/tree/fixes-5.5.2 version
2009.  See also fixes-5.5.2.diff for the differences to the official
source distribution polyml.5.5.2.tar.gz from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/polyml/.


The included build script is used like this:

  ./build src x86-linux --with-gmp
  ./build src x86_64-linux --with-gmp
  ./build src x86-darwin --without-gmp
  ./build src x86_64-darwin --without-gmp
  ./build src x86-cygwin --with-gmp

Also note that the separate "sha1" library module is required for
efficient digesting of strings according to SHA-1.
