Poly/ML for Isabelle
====================

This compilation of Poly/ML 5.5.0 is based on the official sources
from http://www.polyml.org

The included build script is used like this:

  ./build src x86-linux --with-gmp
  ./build src x86_64-linux --with-gmp
  ./build src x86-darwin --without-gmp
  ./build src x86_64-darwin --without-gmp
  ./build src x86-cygwin --with-gmp

Also note that the separate "sha1" library module is required for
efficient digesting of strings according to SHA-1.
