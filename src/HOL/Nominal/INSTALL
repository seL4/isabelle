Installation Notes for the Nominal Datatype Package
===================================================

Although the nominal datatype package is now officially 
part of the development snapshot of Isabelle, we keep 
a semi-official nominal snapshot under

  http://isabelle.in.tum.de/nominal/

This snapshot contains the latest stable release of the
nominal datatype package.

To install it, follow the instructions of Isabelle's INSTALL 
about how a snap-shot can be set up. The building process 
needs to be started inside the [ISABELLE_HOME] directory with 
the command:

   ./build -m HOL-Nominal

After the build completes, install the files with the command

   ./bin/isatool install -p /usr/local/bin

The sources of the nominal datatype package can be found 
in the directory

    [ISABELLE_HOME]/src/HOL/Nominal

The examples are in

    [ISABELLE_HOME]/src/HOL/Nominal/Examples

Starting Isabelle with the Nominal Datatype Package Preloaded
=============================================================

Isabelle including the Proof-General interface can be started

  Isabelle -L HOL-Nominal <<theory file to be opened>> &

This automatically loads the correct keyword file needed
for the nominal datatype package.
