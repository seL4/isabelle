introductions to Isabelle/HOL and the art of

This article presents a Hoare-style calculus for a substantial subset 
of Java Card, which we call Java_light. In particular, the language 
includes side-effecting expressions, mutual recursion, dynamic method 
binding, full exception handling, and static class initialization.

The Hoare logic of partial correctness is proved not only sound (w.r.t.
our operational semantics of Java_light, described in detail elsewhere)
but even complete. It is the first logic for an object-oriented 
language that is provably complete.
The completeness proof uses a refinement of the Most General Formula 
approach. The proof of soundness gives new insights into the role of 
type safety. Further by-products of this work are a new general 
methodology for handling side-effecting expressions and their results, 
the discovery of the strongest possible rule of consequence, and a 
flexible Call rule for mutual recursion. 
We also give a small but non-trivial application example.

All definitions and proofs have been done formally with the interactive 
theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. This guarantees not only rigorous definitions, 
but also gives maximal confidence in the results obtained.},
