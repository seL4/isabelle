<H3> The Hahn-Banach theorem for real vectorspaces (Isabelle/Isar).</H3>

Author:     Gertrud Bauer, Technische Universit&auml;t M&uuml;nchen<P>

This directory contains the proof of the Hahn-Banach theorem for real vectorspaces,
following H. Heuser, Funktionalanalysis, p. 228 -232.
The Hahn-Banach theorem is one of the fundamental theorems of functioal analysis.
It is a conclusion of Zorn's lemma.<P>

Two different formaulations of the theorem are presented, one for general real vectorspaces
and its application to normed vectorspaces. <P>

The theorem says, that every continous linearform, defined on arbitrary subspaces
(not only one-dimensional subspaces), can be extended to a continous linearform on
the whole vectorspace.
