<H2>ZF: Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory</H2>

This directory contains the ML sources of the Isabelle system for
ZF Set Theory, based on FOL.<p>

There are several subdirectories of examples:
<DL>
<DT>AC
<DD>subdirectory containing proofs from the book "Equivalents of the Axiom
of Choice, II" by H. Rubin and J.E. Rubin, 1985.  Thanks to Krzysztof
Gr`abczewski.<P>

<DT>Coind
<DD>subdirectory containing a large example of proof by co-induction.  It
is by Jacob Frost following a paper by Robin Milner and Mads Tofte.<P>

<DT>IMP
<DD>subdirectory containing a semantics equivalence proof between
operational and denotational definitions of a simple programming language.
Thanks to Heiko Loetzbeyer & Robert Sandner.<P>

<DT>Resid
<DD>subdirectory containing a proof of the Church-Rosser Theorem.  It is
by Ole Rasmussen, following the Coq proof by Gérard Huet.<P>

<DT>ex
<DD>subdirectory containing various examples.
</DL>

Isabelle/ZF formalizes the greater part of elementary set theory,
including relations, functions, injections, surjections, ordinals and
cardinals.  Results proved include Cantor's Theorem, the Recursion
Theorem, the Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem, and (assuming AC) the
Wellordering Theorem.<P>

Isabelle/ZF also provides theories of lists, trees, etc., for
formalizing computational notions.  It supports inductive definitions
of infinite-branching trees for any cardinality of branching.<P>
