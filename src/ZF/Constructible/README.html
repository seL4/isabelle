<h1>Constructible--Relative Consistency of the Axiom of Choice</h1>

G&ouml;del's proof of the relative consistency of the axiom of choice is
mechanized using Isabelle/ZF.  The proof builds upon a previous mechanization
of the
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/papers/Sets/reflection.pdf">reflection
theorem</a>.  The heavy reliance on metatheory in the original proof makes the
formalization unusually long, and not entirely satisfactory: two parts of the
proof do not fit together.  It seems impossible to solve these problems
without formalizing the metatheory.  However, the present development follows
a standard textbook, Kunen's <strong>Set Theory</strong>, and could support the
formalization of further material from that book.  It also serves as an
example of what to expect when deep mathematics is formalized.  

A paper describing this development is
