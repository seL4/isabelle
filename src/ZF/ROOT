    Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory. This theory is the work of Martin Coen,
    Philippe Noel and Lawrence Paulson.

    Isabelle/ZF formalizes the greater part of elementary set theory, including
    relations, functions, injections, surjections, ordinals and cardinals.
    Results proved include Cantor's Theorem, the Recursion Theorem, the
    Schroeder-Bernstein Theorem, and (assuming AC) the Wellordering Theorem.

    Isabelle/ZF also provides theories of lists, trees, etc., for formalizing
    computational notions. It supports inductive definitions of
    infinite-branching trees for any cardinality of branching.

    Coind -- A Coinduction Example.

    It involves proving the consistency of the dynamic and static semantics for
    a small functional language. A codatatype definition specifies values and
    value environments in mutual recursion: non-well-founded values represent
    recursive functions; value environments are variant functions from
    variables into values.

    Based upon the article
        Robin Milner and Mads Tofte,
        Co-induction in Relational Semantics,
        Theoretical Computer Science 87 (1991), pages 209-220.

    Relative Consistency of the Axiom of Choice:
    Inner Models, Absoluteness and Consistency Proofs.

    Gödel's proof of the relative consistency of the axiom of choice is
    mechanized using Isabelle/ZF. The proof builds upon a previous
    mechanization of the reflection theorem (see
    http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/papers/Sets/reflection.pdf). The heavy
    reliance on metatheory in the original proof makes the formalization
    unusually long, and not entirely satisfactory: two parts of the proof do
    not fit together. It seems impossible to solve these problems without
    formalizing the metatheory. However, the present development follows a
    standard textbook, Kunen's Set Theory, and could support the formalization
    of further material from that book. It also serves as an example of what to
    expect when deep mathematics is formalized.
